Assuming you are in the directory containing this README:

## To clean:
ant -buildfile src/build.xml clean

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## To compile: 
ant -buildfile src/build.xml all

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## To run by specifying arguments from command line 
## We will use this to run your code
ant -buildfile src/build.xml run -Darg0=input.txt -Darg1=delete.txt -Darg2=output1.txt -Darg3=output2.txt -Darg4=output3.txt

Provide justification for Data Structures used in this assignment in
term of Big O complexity (time and/or space)
I have implemented Binary Search Tree (BST) in this project because insertion is the dominant process and for insertion average time complexity is
O(log n) where n is total number of nodes in BST.

Time complexity:
worst case for searching node, inserting node, deleting node is O(n).

I have used Arraylist to store courses because it can shrink or grow dynamically.

Provide list of citations (urls, etc.) from where you have taken code
(if any).
